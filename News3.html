            <strong>CNN -</strong> The Supreme Court began the year poised to
            build on its 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and to deliver a
            new blow to abortion access.

          <br />
          <p1>
            In January, the court took the extraordinary step of letting Idaho
            enforce its ban on abortion with an exception only to prevent the
            death of a pregnant woman, despite an ongoing challenge from the
            Biden administration arguing that it intruded on federal protections
            for emergency room care. <br />
            <br />
            No recorded vote was made public, but CNN has learned the split was
            6-3, with all six Republican-nominated conservatives backing Idaho,
            over objections from the three Democratic-appointed liberals. But
            over the next six months, sources told CNN, a combination of
            misgivings among key conservatives and rare leverage on the part of
            liberal justices changed the course of the case. The first twist
            came soon after oral arguments in late April, when the justices
            voted in private on the merits of the conflict between Idaho and the
            Biden administration. There suddenly was no clear majority to
            support Idaho, sources said. In fact, there was no clear majority
            for any resolution.<br /><br />
            As a result, Chief Justice John Roberts opted against assigning the
            court’s opinion to anyone, breaking the usual protocol for cases
            after oral arguments. That move would have marked a startling turn
            of events for any dispute, but it was particularly surprising here
            because the court had already given Idaho the advantage by granting
            its appeal before a hearing on the merits of the case could be held
            in a US appellate court. Instead, a series of negotiations led to an
            eventual compromise decision limiting the Idaho law and temporarily
            forestalling further limits on abortion access from the high court.
            The final late-June decision would depart from this year’s pattern
            of conservative dominance.

          <h3>White House response to overturning Roe</h3>
          <p1>
            After the court in June 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, more than a
            dozen states like Idaho began outright banning abortion. The Idaho
            law had exemptions only to prevent death of the pregnant woman and
            in instances of rape or incest. Other states instituted new
            restrictions on the procedure. The Biden administration, supporting
            reproductive rights, tried to immediately counteract some effect of
            the Supreme Court’s decision. It issued formal guidance saying the
            Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires
            stabilizing treatment regardless of a patient’s ability to pay,
            would preempt any state abortion ban in situations when an emergency
            termination was needed.<br />
            <br />
            In August 2022, the Justice Department sued Idaho, seeking an order
            that would block the state from enforcing its ban in emergency rooms
            when it conflicts with EMTALA. Idaho lost in an initial proceeding
            in a US district court, as a judge issued a temporary injunction
            against the abortion ban. While an appeal was pending, Idaho sought
            the high court’s intervention.
            <br />
            <br />
            The impact of the justices’ January order allowing Idaho’s ban to
            take effect was urgent and immediate. The state’s largest provider
            of emergency services increasingly had to airlift pregnant women
            experiencing complications out of state. As the weeks passed and
            Idaho and the federal government began formally making their case in
            filings before scheduled April oral arguments, the situation for
            pregnant women in medical emergencies – risking organ failure, the
            loss of fertility and permanent disability – became more evident. So
            did defects in some of Idaho’s claims. Its lawyers argued that
            EMTALA would require hospitals to terminate a pregnancy if a woman’s
            mental health (rather than physical condition) required it and would
            force individual doctors to perform abortions despite conscience
            objections – two contentions US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar
            said were groundless. Idaho’s built-in lead began to slip,
            particularly against the larger national backdrop over agitation for
            reproductive rights and the politically charged presidential
            election season. The court had given Idaho the advantage in January
            by granting its request for an early hearing. Such expedited review
            is allowed only when, according to Supreme Court procedure, “the
            case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation
            from normal appellate practice.”
            <br />
            <br />
            During the April 24 hearing, signs that the conservative bloc was
            splintering emerged. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who had earlier
            voted to let the Idaho ban be enforced, challenged the state
            lawyer’s assertions regarding the ban’s effect on complications that
            threatened a woman’s reproductive health. She said she was “shocked”
            that he hedged on whether certain grave complications could be
            addressed in an emergency room situation. Barrett’s concerns echoed,
            to some extent, those of the three liberals, all women, who had
            pointed up the dilemma for pregnant women and their physicians.
            Doctors in Idaho had told the court that if they complied with
            federal emergency-care law and helped a pregnant woman in peril,
            they would be risking criminal conviction. Alternatively, if they
            transferred patients needing stabilizing care out of state, they
            risked seriously delaying medical attention and could exacerbate the
            harm.

          <h3>Private vote and rare liberal leverage</h3>
          <p1
            >Judging from the public arguments alone, there appeared a chance
            the court’s four women might vote against Idaho, and the five
            remaining conservatives, all men, in favor of the state and its
            abortion prohibition. But at the justices’ private vote two days
            later, Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh shattered any split along
            gender lines. They expressed an openness to ending the case without
            resolving it. They worked with Barrett on a draft opinion that would
            dismiss the case as “improvidently granted.” Barrett had come to
            believe the case should not have been heard before lower court
            judges had resolved what she perceived to be discrepancies over when
            physicians could perform emergency abortions, even if a threat to
            the woman’s life was not imminent.
            <br />
            <br />
            She would eventually deem acceptance of the case a “miscalculation”
            and suggest she had been persuaded by Idaho’s arguments that its
            emergency rooms would become “federal abortion enclaves governed not
            by state law, but by physician judgment, as enforced by the United
            States’s mandate to perform abortions on demand.” She believed that
            claim was undercut by the US government’s renouncing of abortions
            for mental health and asserting that doctors who have conscience
            objections were exempted. In essence, Barrett, along with Roberts
            and Kavanaugh, were acknowledging they had erred in the original
            action favoring Idaho, something the court is usually loath to
            admit. They attributed it to a misunderstanding of the dueling
            parties’ claims – a misunderstanding not shared by the other six
            justices, who remained firm about which side should win. During a
            wide-ranging talk at a legal conference in Sacramento on Thursday,
            liberal Justice Elena Kagan said the court may have learned “a good
            lesson” from the Idaho case: “And that may be … for us to sort of
            say as to some of these emergency petitions, ‘No, too soon, too
            early. Let the process play out.’” During internal debate from the
            end of April through June, the court’s three other conservative
            justices – Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch believed
            the facts on the ground were clear and that Idaho’s position should
            still prevail. They said the 1986 EMTALA did not require hospitals
            to perform any abortions and could not displace the state’s ban.
