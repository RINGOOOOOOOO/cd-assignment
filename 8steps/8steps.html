        So I want to create a web page that showcase my work and introduce
        myself. I envision a site with a playful and cute visual style, while
        maintaining clarity and ease of navigation. The website will include
        clear sections for my portfolio, skills, and experience, along with
        interactive elements to make it more dynamic and memorable for potential
        employers and collaborators.

        I noticed that many game designers use Itch.io to showcase their game
        projects. The layouts of these pages are very intuitive and visually
        appealing, allowing users to quickly browse through each project. I want
        to achieve this kind of clear and concise layout.<br />

        During my exploration, I also came across some other websites that are
        more experimental and artistic, with less emphasis on commercial
        aspects. However, I also observed that many restaurant or brand websites
        feature very clean designs and strong interactivity. They often combine
        a minimalist user interface with impactful visual presentation.<br />

        This made me realize that design should not only be aesthetically
        pleasing but also ensure a smooth user experience and clear
        functionality.<br />

        <br />
        This website gave me a lot of inspiration. It features a minimalist,
        hand-drawn style that creates an organic, approachable, and creative
        atmosphere. The use of monochrome (black and white) emphasizes
        simplicity and directs focus to the central visualâ€”a stylized
        illustration of the sun. The typography is bold, irregular, and playful,
        evoking a handmade, quirky, and experimental feel. The asymmetrical
        placement of elements adds a sense of movement and spontaneity. It
        maintains user attention through large illustrations supported by subtle
        textual elements. The hand-drawn typography and 3D patterns create a
        distinctive and informal tone, making it ideal for creative portfolios.
        Playful and organic visuals are seamlessly integrated into the design,
        adding a unique character.<br />

        <br />
        I also really like this website's design. It's polished, modern, and
        high-contrast, with an elegant and refined tone. The overall elegant
        tone combines large, eye-catching typography with simple illustrations,
        conveying both professionalism and creativity. It uses monochrome as the
        base with occasional highlights (like product images) to maintain focus
        and provide visual rest. The large headings and spacious white space
        give a clean, breathable feel, making the content easier to read and
        process. The simple navigation, along with a mini menu, is both
        intuitive and user-friendly. It successfully blends playful visuals
        (illustrations) with a serious, professional aesthetic. The 3D mode uses
        bold typography and white space, making the design clear and impactful.
        It incorporates quirky illustrations or animations that add personality
        without making the page cluttered. The project or sections are
        highlighted through carefully selected visual contrasts, such as using
        minimal color accents or featured images.<br />

      <h>Target Your Audience</h>
      <p>
        My primary audience consists of professionals in the fields of
        technology, design, and gaming, such as hiring managers, colleagues, and
        fellow designers and developers. They will expect a portfolio that
        demonstrates both projects and creative design technic, showcasing my
        ability to blend innovation with practical skills.

        I wanted a muted color palette that included some hand-drawn elements,
        such as cartoon faces and organic shapes, paired with clean fonts and a
        harmonious color palette. Or create a retro-inspired event program with
        faux-aged textures and beige backgrounds combined with bold, stylized
        fonts and graffiti-style graphics. The chaotic layout adds to its quirky
        charm. I PREFER to use pink and green gradient, abstract shapes. Want an
        experimental and futuristic feel with a retro punk twist?
