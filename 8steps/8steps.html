      <h>1)Develop Your Idea</h>
      <p>
        So I want to create a web page that showcases my personal work in a way
        that expresses my technical skills clearly, but also appeals to
        potential employers or collaborators. I want the design to showcase
        creativity while remaining easy to use and intuitive for the user.
        <br />
        <!-- I have to make sure that all features are technically possible. For
        example, showcasing the mini-games and websites I've developed along
        with interactive features, such as trial mini-games, are key
        points to consider. -->
      </p>
      <h>2) Discovery and Research</h>
      <p>
        During my exploration, I found some websites that I liked, but they were
        more artistically experimental and less commercial. However, I also saw
        a lot of websites for restaurants or brands that were designed to be
        very clean and interactive, often with a good combination of clean UI
        design and strong visual presentation. This made me realize that a good
        design needs to be not only aesthetically pleasing, but also ensure a
        smooth user experience and clear functionality.

        <br />Also, I noticed that many game designers use Itch.io to showcase
        their game creations. The layout of these pages is very intuitive and
        attractive, especially to allow users to quickly navigate through each
        project.

        <br />
        <!-- So I think my website also needs to do the following: clear navigation
        so that users can quickly find the content they are interested in;
        high-quality visual presentation, including project screenshots and demo
        videos with clear project descriptions; and interesting interactive
        gameplay. -->
      </p>
      <h>3) Target Your Audience</h>
      <p>
        My audience is primarily technical, design and gaming professionals who
        may be hiring managers, coworkers, or other design and developers. They
        should expect to see a portfolio that has both technical depth and
        design creativity.
