              <h1>What is Global Warming?</h1>
              <p>
                Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth’s
                average surface temperature over the past century primarily due
                to the greenhouse gases released as people burn fossil fuels.
                The global average surface temperature rose 0.6 to 0.9 degrees
                Celsius (1.1 to 1.6° F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate of
                temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years.
                Temperatures are certain to go up further.

              <p style="color: white">
                Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air
                pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and
                solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface.
                Normally this radiation would escape into space, but these
                pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the
                atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter.
                These heat-trapping pollutants—specifically carbon dioxide,
                methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated
                gases—are known as greenhouse gases, and their impact is called
                the greenhouse effect.

              <p>
                Each year scientists learn more about the consequences of global
                warming, and each year we also gain new evidence of its
                devastating impact on people and the planet. As the heat waves,
                droughts, and floods associated with climate change become more
                frequent and more intense, communities suffer and death tolls
                rise. If we’re unable to reduce our emissions, scientists
                believe that climate change could lead to the deaths of more
                than 250,000 people around the globe every year and force 100
                million people into poverty by 2030.

              <p>
                Where possible, we can switch to renewable sources of energy
                (such as solar and wind energy) to power our homes and
                buildings, thus emitting far less heat-trapping gases into the
                atmosphere. <br />Where feasible, we can drive electric vehicles
                instead of those that burn fossil fuels; or we can use mass
                transit instead of driving our own cars. <br />Where affordable,
                we can conserve energy by better insulating our homes and
                buildings, and by replacing old, failing appliances with more
                energy-efficient models. <br />Where practicable, we can
                counterbalance our annual carbon dioxide emissions by investing
                in commercial services that draw down an equal amount of carbon
                out of the atmosphere, such as through planting trees or carbon
                capture and storage techniques.<br />
                Where practical, we can support more local businesses that use
                and promote sustainable, climate-smart practices such as those
                listed above. <br />We can consider placing an upper limit on
                the amount of carbon dioxide we will allow ourselves to emit
                into the atmosphere within a given timeframe.
