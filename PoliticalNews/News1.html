            <strong>CNN -</strong> The Supreme Court on Monday left in place a
            court order blocking the Biden administration from enforcing in
            Texas its policy of requiring hospitals to provide emergency
            abortion care or risk losing federal funding.

            The justices rejected a Justice Department request that they wipe
            away the lower-court ruling and send the case back down for more
            proceedings. That ruling had struck down guidance from the
            Department of Health and Human Services asserting that, under
            federal law, hospitals were obligated to offer abortion in medical
            emergencies even in states that ban the procedure. <br />
            <br />
            The move is setback for the Biden administration in its uphill
            effort to assert some protections for abortion access since the
            <a href="News2.html"
              ><strong>Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022</strong></a
            >.
            <br />
            <br />
            Monday's maneuver also keeps abortion off the Supreme Court's docket
            - for now - after two major abortion cases last term, including one
            from Idaho raising very similar issues as the Texas dispute.
            <br />
            <br />
            The high court's handling of both the Idaho and Texas cases leaves
            unanswered questions about whether, under a law known as the
            Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, federally-funded
            hospitals must offer abortions to emergency patients with pregnancy
            complications putting their health at risk - even in states that ban
            the procedure.<br />
            <br />
            Texas, joined by other plaintiffs, successfully sued to halt Biden
            administration guidance to hospitals asserting that EMTALA trumps
            state abortion bans. A ruling blocking the administration from
            enforcing the policy in the Lone Star State was upheld by the 5th US
            Circuit Court of Appeals.
            <br />
            <br />
            US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar had asked the Supreme Court
            to wipe away that ruling and instruct the lower courts to reconsider
            the case with more recent legal developments in mind.
            <br />
            <br />
            Last term, the
            <a href="News3.html">
              <strong
                >Supreme Court punted on a similar case arising out of
                Idaho</strong
              ></a
            >, where the Justice Department sued the state over its strict
            abortion ban, alleging that the ban violated EMTALA for its lack of
            exemptions for abortions when pregnancy complications imperil
            woman's bodily functions but do not yet imperil her life.<br />
            <br />
            The Supreme Court paused a lower court's order blocking the ban in
            medical emergencies and took up the case before a full appeal played
            out in lower courts, only to rule 5-4 this summer that the case had
            been taken up prematurely, sending it back to lower courts.
