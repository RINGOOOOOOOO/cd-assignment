            <strong>CNN -</strong> Two years ago, the US Supreme Court
            overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an
            abortion and setting off a fierce fight for reproductive rights at
            the state level.

            Abortion has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 election, and as
            access narrows in many states, reproductive freedom advocates are
            working to get measures preserving reproductive rights on the
            November ballot to let voters weigh in.</p1

          <h3>Abortion rates reach a decade-long high in the US</h3>

          <p1>
            Two years after Roe v. Wade was overturned, 14 states have total or
            near-total bans on abortion, including Alabama, Texas, Idaho and
            Tennessee.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite an increase in restrictive policies, the number and rate of
            abortions in 2023 hit their highest point in over a decade,
            according to a report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and
            policy non-profit that advocates for sexual and reproductive health
            rights.
            <br />
            <br />
            The organization estimates there were more than 1 million abortions
            in the formal US healthcare system last year, a 11% increase from
            2020. States without total abortion bans saw a 26% increase from
            2020, according to the report.<br />
            <br />
            The loss of abortion access in states with bans, the authors noted,
            was countered by “efforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and
            logistical support organizations to help people…access care.”Nearly
            two-thirds of all abortions in 2023, about 642,700, were medication
            abortions - not including self-managed medication abortions outside
            of the healthcare setting, the report says. The authors note a
            steady increase since 2001, when medication abortions accounted for
            less than 10% of all procedures. Over the years, the US Food and
            Drug Administration relaxed some of the restrictions for use of the
            abortion pill, and access to the medication increased. In 2016, the
            agency deemed the abortion pill safe to use up to 10 weeks into
            pregnancy, rather than seven, and expanded the pool of providers who
            could prescribe it. After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the
            FDA allowed for the pill to be dispensed by certified pharmacies and
            through the mail, rather than just in healthcare settings.
          </p1>
          <h3>States implement increasingly restrictive abortion policies</h3>
          <p1>
            Abortion policies have changed rapidly in many states since the
            Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe. Four states, California,
            Michigan, Vermont and Ohio, have since enshrined rights to
            reproductive freedom in their constitutions, while lawmakers in New
            York and other states implemented policies to protect abortion
            patients and providers.
            <br />
            <br />
            More than a dozen states passed abortion “trigger laws” ahead of the
            court's decision, meant to take effect almost immediately in the
            event that Roe was overturned, and at least seven states without
            trigger laws have followed suit with restrictive reproductive health
            policies that critics say put patients in danger and leave providers
            at risk of civil and criminal liability.<br />
            <br />
            Patients and providers have struggled to navigate a patchwork of
            sometimes hastily implemented abortion policies that include
            mandatory waiting periods to obtain an abortion in states including
            Arizona and Georgia, limits on Medicaid coverage for abortion, in
            states including South Dakota, and vague language around medical
            emergency exceptions to abortion bans in states including Texas.
            Lower courts have been asked to take abortion issues up in multiple
            legal challenges across states.
          </p1>
          <h3>Patients cross state lines to access reproductive care</h3>
          <p1>
            Abortion policies have changed rapidly in many states since the
            Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe. Four states, California,
            Michigan, Vermont and Ohio, have since enshrined rights to
            reproductive freedom in their constitutions, while lawmakers in New
            York and other states implemented policies to protect abortion
            patients and providers.
            <br />
            <br />
            More than 171,000 patients travelled for an abortion in 2023,
            according to the Guttmacher Institute.<br />
            <br />
            Many people who traveled to obtain abortions before Roe was
            overturned were going to states that now have total abortion bans,
            meaning people are now traveling farther distances - sometimes
            crossing multiple state lines - to access care, the organization
            noted recently.
            <br />
            <br />
            In just the first half of 2023, nearly 1 in 5 people who had an
            abortion - more than 92,000 people - traveled across state lines for
            abortion care, according to a December 2023 analysis from the
            institute. As the abortion care landscape becomes more and more
            restrictive, Alexandra Mandado, president of Planned Parenthood in
            South, East and North Florida, says that remaining abortion clinics
            will struggle to absorb the increase in out-of-state patients.
