        website?</h
      >
      <p style="line-height: 20px; font-size: 0.8rem">
        In the Design and Technology field, employers look for a website that
        effectively showcases your creativity, technical skills, and project
        experience. They value a professional, visually appealing design that
        reflects your understanding of design principles and user experience.
        The website should highlight a diverse range of projects, demonstrating
        your ability to handle different challenges and tools. Clear, detailed
        case studies and project descriptions are crucial, as they provide
        insight into your problem-solving process and outcomes. Employers also
        appreciate a well-organized portfolio that is easy to navigate, along
        with a resume and contact information that make it simple to reach you.
        Additionally, a responsive design that looks good on various devices can
        be a significant plus, showing that you can create user-friendly
        experiences across different platforms.

      </h>
      <p style="line-height: 20px; font-size: 0.8rem">
        When you have only two years of school work to showcase, focus on
        presenting projects that best highlight your skillset and
        problem-solving abilities. Select work that demonstrates a range of
        technical and design skills, such as complex design solutions,
        innovative problem-solving, and effective use of tools and technologies.
        Include projects that had significant challenges where you employed
        critical thinking and creative solutions, and provide detailed case
        studies that explain your approach, the obstacles you faced, and the
        results achieved. Prioritize quality over quantity by choosing projects
        that reflect your growth, versatility, and ability to tackle diverse
        problems, ensuring that each piece clearly illustrates your competencies
        and accomplishments.

        What can I do to make it that way?</h
      >
      <p style="line-height: 20px; font-size: 0.8rem">
        It's very important for your website to stand out and be memorable, as
        it helps you leave a lasting impression on potential employers or
        clients. A unique, well-designed website reflects your personal brand
        and creativity, which can set you apart from other candidates. To make
        your website stand out, focus on creating a clean, visually striking
        design with a clear, intuitive layout that is easy to navigate.
        Incorporate engaging elements such as interactive features, animations,
        or unique typography that aligns with your design style. Use a
        consistent color scheme and branding throughout, and make sure your
        personality comes through in the way you present your work.
        Additionally, ensure that your content is concise yet impactful, and
        that your projects clearly showcase your strengths and problem-solving
        skills. A memorable user experience can leave a positive impression and
        increase the chances of recruiters remembering you.
